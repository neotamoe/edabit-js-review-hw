# Edabit Homework
This assignment was completed during my time at Prime Digital Academy in the last week of Tier 2 (the in-class lecture 
portion of the program; approximately 2/3 of the way through the total 20-week program).  Using the site https://edabit.com I solved problems using local files and the edabit interface itself
to submit answers on the site.  

The problems done for this assignment were sorting an array based on even or odd numbers and capitalizing the first letter of each word.
I completed part of the pig latin problem.

### Original Instructions

#### JS Review Hw
Using the https://edabit.com/ site we used in class today. Do the following problems. Create a repo locally with a script.js and index.html file to test the problems as you go.

Check your answers on the edabit site before submitting the github repo. They have a lot of tests that should all pass if you have met all the requirements.

Submit the github repo. We encourage you to continue to do some of these problems as these types of questions are great for interview practice.

##### Base Mode
For all these problems don't forget to look at the resources tab to get pointed in the right direction. After getting the tests to pass, look at the solutions tab for other ideas of how to solve it.

###### Problem 1: Even or Odd?

Try solving it with the ternary operator if you can.

###### Problem 2: Capitalize The First Letter Of Each Word

Try solving it with the map function. 

##### Hard Mode
###### Problem 3: Pig Latin

To match vowels try using this RegEx function:
```
function isVowel(aLetter){
  var re = /^[aeiou]$/i;
  return re.test(aLetter);
}
```
